🚀 Project Update: Plant Disease Prediction Model 🌱

I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully built a Plant Disease Prediction Model using machine learning! 🌾✨

📌 Problem Statement

Plant diseases, especially fungal infections, are a major cause of crop losses globally. These diseases are often triggered by environmental factors like high humidity, temperature, and rainfall. Early prediction of disease outbreaks enables farmers to take preventive actions, optimize pesticide use, and improve crop yield.

This project leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the likelihood of plant disease based on real-time environmental data.

📂 Dataset Overview

The synthetic dataset consists of 10,000 samples simulating diverse environmental conditions across different farm locations. Each sample includes environmental measurements and a binary label indicating plant health.

🔑 Charecteristics

1.temperature — Ambient temperature (°C)

2.humidity — Air humidity (%)

3.rainfall — Rainfall (mm)

4.soil_pH — Soil pH value

5.disease_present — Target label (0 = Healthy, 1 = Diseased)

🎯 Objective

Train a binaryclassification model using a Decision Tree to predict plant disease presence from environmental factors.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1.Python

2.Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier)

3.Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

4.Jupyter Notebook

5.Streamlit (for web UI)

📈 Potential Applications

 1.Smart farming platforms
 
 2.Weather-based plant disease alert systems
 
 3.Precision agriculture dashboards
